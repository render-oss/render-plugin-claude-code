  instances for caching, session storage, and job queues. Use when the user
  needs Key Value, uses Redis or Valkey, or needs a cache, session store, or job queue backend,
  or needs to configure maxmemory policy, ipAllowList, connection strings,
  or internal vs external access.

# Render Key Value

Render Key Value provides low-latency, Redis-compatible in-memory storage running **Valkey 8**. Use it as a shared cache, session store, or job queue backend. Compatible with virtually all Redis client libraries.

## When to Use

- Adding a **cache** or **session store** to a web app
- Wiring a **job queue** backend for Celery, Sidekiq, BullMQ, Asynq, or Oban
- Choosing the right **maxmemory policy** (cache vs queue)
- Configuring **ipAllowList** in Blueprints (required field)
- Connecting via **internal vs external URLs**
- Troubleshooting **auth failures** or **connection refused** errors

For background worker setup and queue framework patterns, see **render-background-workers**. For Blueprint authoring, see **render-blueprints**.

Before configuring or troubleshooting an internal Key Value connection, read `references/private-networking.md`.

## Key Concepts

### Valkey 8 (not Redis)

New instances run **Valkey 8**, an open-source Redis fork. It is a drop-in replacement for Redis—existing Redis client libraries work without changes. Legacy instances (created before Feb 2025) run Redis 6.

### Connection URLs

Every instance has two URLs:

| URL type | When to use | Auth required |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Internal** (`redis://red-xxx:6379`) | From Render services in the same workspace and region | No (by default) |
| **External** (`rediss://red-xxx:6379`) | From outside Render (local dev, CI) | Always |

**Always prefer the internal URL** for production services—lower latency, no TLS overhead, communicates over the private network.

External connections are **disabled by default**. Enable them by adding IP ranges to the access control list in the Dashboard.

### Internal authentication

By default, internal connections are unauthenticated. You can **require auth for internal connections** in the Dashboard for compliance or extra security. This changes the internal URL to include credentials:

```
redis://default:PASSWORD@red-xxx:6379
```

**Warning:** Enabling internal auth breaks existing unauthenticated connections. Migrate clients to the authenticated URL first.

## Maxmemory Policy

**Critical decision.** Choose based on your use case:

| Use case | Policy | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **Cache** (can lose data) | `allkeys-lru` | Evicts least-recently-used keys to free space |
| **Job queue** (cannot lose data) | `noeviction` | Returns error on writes when full; never drops keys |
| **Session store** | `allkeys-lru` or `volatile-lru` | Sessions can be regenerated; LRU is safe |

All available policies:

| Policy | Behavior | Memory fills up? |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| `allkeys-lru` | Evict any key by LRU | No |
| `noeviction` | Error on writes when full | Yes |
| `volatile-lru` | Evict keys with TTL by LRU | Yes |
| `volatile-lfu` | Evict keys with TTL by LFU | Yes |
| `allkeys-lfu` | Evict any key by LFU | No |
| `volatile-random` | Evict random keys with TTL | Yes |
| `allkeys-random` | Evict any random key | No |
| `volatile-ttl` | Evict keys nearest to expiry | Yes |

## Blueprint Configuration

```yaml
services:
  - type: keyvalue
    name: cache
    plan: starter
    region: oregon
    maxmemoryPolicy: allkeys-lru
    ipAllowList: []
```

### `ipAllowList` is required

Blueprints **must** include `ipAllowList` on Key Value services. Common patterns:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `[]` | No external access (internal only—**recommended for most apps**) |
| `[{source: "0.0.0.0/0", description: "everywhere"}]` | Open external access (use sparingly) |
| `[{source: "203.0.113.0/24", description: "office"}]` | Specific IP ranges |

### Wiring to services

Use `fromService` with `type: keyvalue` and `property: connectionString`:

```yaml
envVars:
  - key: REDIS_URL
    fromService:
      name: cache
      type: keyvalue
      property: connectionString
```

Available `fromService` properties for Key Value:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `connectionString` | Full internal URL (`redis://red-xxx:6379`) |
| `host` | Hostname only |
| `port` | Port only (typically `6379`) |

## Data Persistence

- **Paid instances:** Disk-backed, `appendfsync everysec`. You may lose up to 1 second of writes on interruption.
- **Free instances:** No disk persistence. Data is lost on restart or upgrade.
- **Upgrading from Free:** All data is lost during the upgrade because Free instances have no disk.

## Compute Plans and Changes

The compute plan determines available memory and connection limits. Use `references/compute-plans.md` for current Plan IDs and Key Value-specific change guidance.

## Connection Examples

See `references/connection-examples.md` for client code in Node.js (ioredis, node-redis), Python (redis-py), Ruby (redis-rb, Sidekiq), and Go.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Missing `ipAllowList` in Blueprint | Add `ipAllowList: []` for internal-only access |
| Using `allkeys-lru` for job queues | Switch to `noeviction`—LRU eviction drops queued jobs |
| Connecting with external URL from a Render service | Use the internal URL for lower latency and no auth requirement |
| Forgetting `type: keyvalue` in `fromService` | `type` is required; without it the wiring fails |
| Using deprecated `redis` type alias | Prefer `keyvalue` in new Blueprints (`redis` still works but is deprecated) |

## Current documentation retrieval

Whenever this skill directs you to consult current Render documentation:

1. Retrieve the linked Markdown document directly with an available URL-fetching tool or HTTP client, such as `curl`. Do not substitute web-search summaries for the document.
2. Confirm that retrieval succeeded and returned the expected document, then read its contents. Saving a file or printing its path is not sufficient.
3. If the request fails or your tool cannot read the Markdown response, open and read the linked HTML version instead.
4. If neither version can be retrieved, disclose that the current reference is unavailable and follow any topic-specific fallback in the skill. Use bundled guidance only for stable constraints, and do not guess at changeable platform details.

When a task requires multiple references, apply this workflow to each one and distinguish the documents you verified from those that remain unavailable.
