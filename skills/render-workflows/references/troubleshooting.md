# Troubleshooting

Use this reference for common Render Workflows setup, registration, execution, and client failures. Check the current [Workflows documentation](https://render.com/docs/workflows) and installed SDK version before relying on an implementation detail.

## CLI and Local Server

### `render workflows` or a subcommand is unavailable

Run `render --version` and upgrade the CLI. Different workflow features arrived in different versions; this skill uses 2.16.0 or later for scaffolding, local development, and CLI deployment.

On macOS with Homebrew:

```bash
brew upgrade render
```

For other platforms, follow the current [CLI installation guide](https://render.com/docs/cli#installation).

### Local task server does not start

| Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Start command is wrong | Run the same entrypoint used by the workflow service, such as `python main.py` or `npm start`. |
| Python dependencies are in a virtual environment | Use its interpreter, such as `.venv/bin/python main.py`. |
| Python entrypoint does not call `app.start()` | Add the call to the executed entrypoint. |
| Port is occupied | Start with `--port <port>` and pass the same port to every local CLI or SDK call. |
| Docker-based workflow | Use a native local entrypoint or test after deployment; Docker workflows do not currently support the local task server. |

Do not run a Python workflow entrypoint directly when it expects Render runtime variables. Start it through:

```bash
render workflows dev -- python main.py
```

### Environment variables are missing locally

The CLI loads `.env` from its current directory. Run from the intended workflow root, or pass one or more explicit files:

```bash
render workflows dev --env-file .env --env-file .env.local -- python main.py
```

Later files override earlier ones. Confirm that secrets are ignored by Git and do not print their values during diagnosis.

## SDK 1.x Migration Failures

### Python cannot import `render_sdk`

The current Python distribution and import module are named `render`:

```bash
python -m pip install 'render>=1.0.1'
python -c 'import render; print(render.__file__)'
```

Update imports such as:

```python
from render import Render, Retry, TaskContext, Workflows
```

### Task registration rejects the function signature

Every task must accept `TaskContext` as its first positional parameter, including tasks that do not use it:

```python
@app.task
def ping(_ctx: TaskContext) -> str:
    return "pong"
```

```typescript
task({ name: "ping" }, (_ctx: TaskContext) => "pong");
```

The context is supplied by Render and is not included in CLI, SDK, or API task input.

### A registered task is “not callable”

SDK 1.x returns a task definition, not a callable wrapper.

- From another task, use `await ctx.run(task_definition, ...args)`.
- In a unit test, call `task_definition.func(fake_context, ...args)` explicitly.
- From an application or script, use `Render().workflows.start_task()` or `run_task()` and the task slug.

Do not restore direct calls as a workaround; direct calls would bypass distributed execution and task-run observability.

## Task Registration

### Local task list is empty or missing tasks

| Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Missing `--local` | Use `render workflows tasks list --local`. |
| Server is not running | Start `render workflows dev` in another terminal first. |
| Python module is not incorporated | Import its `Workflows` object and combine apps with `Workflows.from_workflows(...)`. |
| TypeScript module is not imported | Add a synchronous module import to the entrypoint. |
| TypeScript task registered after auto-start | Define and import tasks synchronously at module scope; avoid dynamic imports for registration. |
| Duplicate task name | Give every task a unique registered name. |

TypeScript's registry can replace a previous task with the same name, so detect duplicates during review rather than relying on a runtime error.

### TypeScript exits during auto-start

The TypeScript SDK auto-starts task registration when `RENDER_SDK_SOCKET_PATH` is present. Use the Render CLI locally. Only set `RENDER_SDK_AUTO_START=false` when deliberately taking manual control of startup.

## Task Execution

### Chained run hangs or never starts

Check that:

- The parent task is `async`.
- The child is registered in the same workflow service.
- The call is `await ctx.run(child, ...)`.
- Parallel calls are collected with `asyncio.gather`, `asyncio.TaskGroup`, `Promise.all`, or a deliberate equivalent.

Awaiting each independent child one at a time makes the chain serial rather than parallel.

### Python rejects mixed task arguments

`ctx.run` accepts positional arguments or named arguments, not both in the same call:

```python
await ctx.run(task, first, second)
await ctx.run(task, left=first, right=second)
```

The same distinction applies when triggering a Python task through the SDK: send a list for positional input or a dictionary for named input.

### Input or result is not JSON-serializable

Convert values to JSON-compatible objects before passing or returning them. In particular, encode dates, byte strings, sets, class instances, and TypeScript `BigInt` values explicitly.

For current payload-size limits, consult [Limits and Pricing for Render Workflows](https://render.com/docs/workflows-limits).

### Retried task duplicates a side effect

Retries rerun task logic. Use idempotency keys, upserts, transactional guards, or downstream deduplication for writes, payments, messages, and other mutations. Do not enable retries on unsafe operations without a repeat-safety strategy.

### Timeout or compute plan is rejected

Verify the task option name first:

- Python task: `timeout_seconds=` and `plan=`
- Python workflow default: `default_timeout=` and `default_plan=`
- TypeScript task: `timeoutSeconds` and `plan`

Then resolve current timeout bounds and compute-plan IDs from [Limits and Pricing for Render Workflows](https://render.com/docs/workflows-limits). Do not substitute a remembered legacy plan name.

## API Client

### `await Render()` fails in Python

`Render` is synchronous. Use `RenderAsync` in an async context:

```python
from render import RenderAsync

render = RenderAsync()
result = await render.workflows.run_task("my-workflow/task", [42])
```

Use `Render` without `await` in synchronous code.

### Unauthorized or API key missing

The SDK uses `RENDER_API_KEY` unless a token is passed to the constructor. Confirm that the key belongs to a user with access to the workflow's workspace. Never log or commit the key.

### Client wait was aborted but the run continues

Canceling a TypeScript `AbortSignal`, closing an SSE stream, or interrupting a local wait does not cancel the remote run. Call the explicit cancellation method with the root task run ID:

```typescript
await render.workflows.cancelTaskRun(taskRunId);
```

Canceling a root run cancels its active chained runs. A child run is not an independent cancellation target.

### Run listing shape is unexpected

Current list methods return cursor-bearing wrappers:

- Python: access `.task_run` on each item.
- TypeScript: access `.taskRun` on each item.

Use the returned cursor for pagination instead of assuming one call returns all runs.

### Rate limiting or queued runs

API-triggered runs and chained runs have different limits and queueing behavior. Consult [Limits and Pricing for Render Workflows](https://render.com/docs/workflows-limits) for current API rate, compute, and queueing rules. Back off on rate-limit responses; do not assume those requests were queued.

## Deployment

### `render workflows create` fails

Confirm the active workspace, backing Git remote, repository access, runtime, root directory, and exact build/run commands. For non-interactive creation, required fields must be passed as flags.

If `--repo .` cannot resolve the repository, inspect the local Git remote and pass the supported Git provider URL explicitly.

### Tasks do not appear after deployment

Check the workflow's build and release logs. Confirm that the deployed start command executes the same entrypoint verified locally and that all task modules are imported during registration.

To release a new version explicitly and wait for the outcome:

```bash
render workflows versions release <workflow-id> --wait
```

### Blueprint sync fails or the workflow is missing from a preview

Workflows are valid Blueprint services (`type: workflow`). Common failures:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Schema / validate error on `plan` | Service-level `plan` is not allowed on workflows | Remove `plan`. Set compute on the task in code. |
| Workflow deploys but behaves unexpectedly with `runtime: docker` | Workflow runtimes are `python` and `node` only. `render blueprints validate` currently accepts `runtime: docker` on a workflow even though the published schema rejects it, so a passing validate is not proof the runtime is supported | Use `runtime: python` or `runtime: node`. Validate against `https://render.com/schema/render.yaml.json` rather than trusting the CLI result alone |
| Preview stack has no workflow | Preview environments skip workflows | Expected. Other services still replicate. Trigger tasks against the non-preview workflow or deploy the workflow separately. |
| Blueprint rejected for duplicate name | A Blueprint-managed workflow with that `name` already exists in the workspace | Rename the service, or adopt the existing resource instead of creating a second one |

Do not copy the stale Workflows FAQ bullet that says Blueprints cannot manage workflows. Confirm against the [changelog](https://render.com/changelog/added-blueprint-support-for-render-workflows) and `https://render.com/schema/render.yaml.json`.
